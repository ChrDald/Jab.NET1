The BeatPaths sample demonstrates reading XML data describing the relative rankings of NFL teams
at a particular moment of time and generating a diagram from that data.
The ranking information came from www.beatpaths.com.
</p>
<p>
The XML data is basically a list of relationships.
This uses Linq for XML to read the data, which is stored as an embedded resource file.
To hold the link relationship data in memory we define a simple data class named <b>Beat</b>.
Because the model and data are static (read-only), the <b>Beat</b> class does not need to implement
<b>INotifyPropertyChanged</b> and call <b>RaisePropertyChanged</b> when the value
of any of its properties changes.
</p>
<p>
Unlike most XML data, there are no elements describing the nodes --
the node definitions are implicit in the references from the links.
Hence the <b>Diagram.Model</b> sets <b>NodeKeyIsNodeData</b> and
<b>NodeKeyReferenceAutoInserts</b> to true.
</p>
<p>
The node template uses a <b>TextImageSourceConverter</b> to convert the team name
into an <b>ImageSource</b> referring to an image on our web site.
If you are running this application with limited permissions, you might not be able
to see the images on our web site.</p>
