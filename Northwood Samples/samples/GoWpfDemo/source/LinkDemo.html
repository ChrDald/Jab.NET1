Shows the effect of some different properties on <strong>Node</strong>s and on
<strong>Link</strong>s.&nbsp; This sample supports dynamically 
changing a node&#39;s figure, &quot;from&quot; port spot, and &quot;to&quot; port spot, or a link&#39;s routing, curve, curviness, smoothness,
&quot;to&quot; arrow, &quot;from&quot; arrow, and arrow scale properties.  In addition, the To and FromShortLength properties can be manipulated
in order to create offsets which eliminates intersection between the <strong>Route</strong> the <strong>Arrowheads</strong>.</p> 
<p> 
Those properties on <strong>Node</strong>s and <strong>Link</strong>s are data-bound to properties in their respective data classes,
<strong>MyNodeData </strong>and <strong>MyLinkData</strong>.&nbsp; For example, 
the <strong>go:NodePanel.Figure</strong> attached property on the node shape is 
bound in XAML as follows:</p>
<pre>     go:NodePanel.Figure=&quot;{Binding Path=Data.Figure}&quot;</pre>
<p>The <strong>Figure</strong> property is defined in the <strong>MyNodeData</strong> 
class as follows:</p>
<font face="Courier New">  
<pre>   // The NodeFigure which is used in the NodeTemplate.
  public NodeFigure Figure {
    get { return _Figure; }
    set {
      if (_Figure != value) {
        NodeFigure old = _Figure;
        _Figure = value;
        RaisePropertyChanged(&quot;Figure&quot;, old, value);
      }
    }
  }
  private NodeFigure _Figure = NodeFigure.Actor; 
</pre> 
 
<p>In order to correctly update properties on a particular <strong>Node</strong> 
via its <strong>DataTemplate</strong> bindings, a call to the <b>RaisePropertyChanged</b> 
method is needed, but only when the value has actually changed.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, it needs to pass both the original and the new value, to support 
undo/redo functionality.</p>
<p>When you add properties to your data classes, if you expect those values to 
change dynamically, you&#39;ll need to implement properties in the manner shown 
above.&nbsp; However the <strong>Color</strong> and <strong>Thickness</strong> 
data properties of <strong>MyNodeData</strong> and <strong>MyLinkData </strong>are not 
expected to change after initialization in this sample -- thus they do not 
implement property-change notification.</p>
