The Flowgrammer sample demonstrates the use of interaction between ListBoxes and Palettes, Drag/Drop behavior, and custom classes including an overriden <b>PartManager</b> and an overriden <b>DraggingTool</b>.
</p>
<p>
On the top left side of the sample is a ListBox, allowing for the selection of which type of Nodes should be displayed in the Palette below.
A ListBox is initialized in XAML in the following code segment.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;ListBox Grid.Row="0" Padding="5" BorderThickness="1" Margin="2" BorderBrush="Black"
               SelectionChanged="listBox_SelectionChanged"&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content="If" /&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content="Action" /&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content="Effect" /&gt;
        &lt;ListBoxItem Content="Output" /&gt;
      &lt;/ListBox&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The SelectionChanged event is raised whenever the user selects a different item in the ListBox. The following code is used to 
handle these events and accordingly change the type of Node displayed in the Palette below.
</p>
<pre>
private void listBox_SelectionChanged(object sender, System.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs e) {
      ListBoxItem lbi = (sender as ListBox).SelectedItem as ListBoxItem;
      switch (lbi.Content as String) {
        case "If":
          myPalette.Model.NodesSource = paletteOptions[0];
          break;
        case "Action":
          myPalette.Model.NodesSource = paletteOptions[1];
          break;
        case "Effect":
          myPalette.Model.NodesSource = paletteOptions[2];
          break;
        case "Output":
          myPalette.Model.NodesSource = paletteOptions[3];
          break;
      }
    }
</pre>
<p>
One of the key features of the Flowgrammer sample is the use of a custom DraggingTool. Creating a custom DraggingTool allows the
developer to change how the Drag/Drop behavior of the Palette and Diagram will work. In this case, the <b>DragOver</b> method is overriden
to allow for changes in opacity of the Node being dragged, as well as highlighting of the Part that the Node is currently dragged over.
There is also an overriden <b>DropOnto</b> method to prevent drops onto the background. Another function of the overriden DropOnto method is 
that when the dragged Node is dropped on a Link or another Node, the methods InsertNodeOnLink or InsertNodeBeforeNode can be invoked.
Simple overrides of methods like this allow the developer lots of customization in the way they want their tools to work.   
</p>
<p>
The other GoXam class overriden is the <b>PartManager</b>. The only change to the PartManager is a modified way of removing Nodes from the Model.
When a Node is removed from Flowgrammer, depending on what type of Node it is, a different action will occur. One of the more interesting 
actions to take place is the removal of an "If" Node. To remove an "If" Node, all the Nodes within its subgraph must be removed as well.
GetOtherEnd() is used recursively until the Node where the two branches come back together is found. 
</p>
<pre>public Node GetOtherEnd(Node node, String portid) {
      if (node.FindPort(portid, true) != null)
        if (portid == "TopPort")
          foreach (Node n in node.FindNodesIntoPort(portid))
            return n;
        else
          foreach (Node n in node.FindNodesOutOfPort(portid))
            return n;
      return null;
    }
</pre>
<p>
GetOtherEnd makes extensive use of the <b>Node.FindNodesIntoPort</b> and <b>Node.FindNodesOutOfPort</b> methods to determine the Node on the opposite end
of a given Port and allows Node-by-Node navigation of a Model even without Links.
