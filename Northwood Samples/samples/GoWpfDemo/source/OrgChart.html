This sample demonstrates how a diagram can be used to display a hierarchical organization.&nbsp; 
The organization information is contained in an XML file.&nbsp; In this demo the 
XML file is stored as a manifest resource -- of course you could acquire the XML 
data in some other manner.</p>
	<p>
	The sample uses Linq for XML to read the XML and saves the information for 
	each element in instances of the <strong>OrgMember </strong>sample class.&nbsp; 
	That information includes the bitmap image of the national flag for each 
	person.&nbsp; These image files are also stored as manifest resources and 
	are converted to instances of <strong>BitmapSource</strong> for display by 
	each node.</p>
	<p>
	Note that besides the information about people in the organization, there is 
	some document-level information stored on the root XML element.&nbsp; In 
	this sample it is stored on the <strong>OrgChart</strong> <strong>
	UserControl </strong>as additional properties, which is used as the <strong>
	DataContext</strong> for the XAML that wants to present that information.</p>
	<p>
	Each node is implemented by a <strong>NodeTemplate</strong> that uses a
	<strong>Grid</strong> to show text and an image of a flag.&nbsp; Because 
	flags have different natural aspect ratios that we want to maintain while 
	keeping a constant height, the <strong>Width</strong> is data-bound to the 
	image using a special converter, <strong>ImageSizeConverter</strong>, that 
	returns the desired width.</p>
	<p>
	The initial scale and position of the diagram is specified by the <strong>
	InitialScale</strong>, <strong>InitialPanelSpot</strong>, and <strong>
	InitialDiagramBoundsSpot</strong> properties.&nbsp; The two <strong>...Spot</strong> 
	properties specify what point in the <strong>Diagram.Panel</strong> to 
	position a point in the <strong>Panel.DiagramBounds</strong>.&nbsp; The 
	diagram bounds is a <strong>Rect</strong> that describes the extent of the 
	nodes and links.</p>
	<p>
	This sample also demonstrates the use of the <strong>Overview</strong> control.
	It it a diagram that shows the viewport of another <strong>Diagram</strong> within
	that other diagram's model.  The <strong>Overview</strong> needs to have a reference
	to that other diagram as its <strong>Overview.Observed</strong> property.
	That reference should be established after both the observed diagram and the observing
	overview are initialized, so the <code>myOverview.Observed = myDiagram</code>
	assignment is performed in a <strong>Loaded</strong> event handler.</p>
	<p>
	The diagram uses a <strong>TreeLayout</strong> to achieve the automatic 
	positioning of the nodes.&nbsp; The <strong>Angle</strong> attribute 
	represents the direction in which the tree will grow; a value of 90 degrees 
	causes the tree to grow downwards.</p>
