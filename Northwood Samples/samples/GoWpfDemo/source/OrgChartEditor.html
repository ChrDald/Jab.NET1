  This sample demonstrates how a diagram can be used to display and edit a hierarchical organization.&nbsp; 
  </p>
	<p>
	The sample uses Linq for XML to read the XML and saves the information for 
	each element in instances of the <strong>Employee</strong> sample class.&nbsp;
	The node DataTemplate displays several <strong>TextBlock</strong>s that are data-bound to
	properties on the <strong>Employee</strong> class: Name, Title, Key, ParentKey, Comment.
    </p>
	<p>
    Once a node is selected, clicking on the name, the title, or the comment text starts in-place
    editing of the text using a <strong>TextBox</strong>, dynamically created by the
    <strong>TextEditingTool</strong>.
    When the user hits Enter or Tab or when they click elsewhere to accept any text changes,
    the <strong>TextEditingTool</strong> will set the original <strong>TextBlock</strong>'s
    Text property to the new string.
    Because the data-bindings of the Name, Title, and Comment properties are TwoWay,
    this will also automatically update the properties on the corresponding <strong>Employee</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The user can easily create a new node connected to an existing node by double-clicking on a node.
	The <strong>Node_MouseLeftButtonDown</strong> method is called on each mouse down, but if it's a
	double-click, the method traverses up the visual tree from the <i>sender</i> to find the clicked
	<strong>Node</strong>.
	Note that other mouse-down operations, such as selecting or dragging, do not need to be implemented
	by an event handler on the node, because they are implemented by the <b>Diagram</b>'s mouse tools.
	</p>
	<p>
	It can then create a new <strong>Employee</strong> data object and initialize it.
	Note in particular that it sets the <strong>ParentKey</strong> property to connect the
	new node to the existing node as the "parent" -- i.e. the boss/supervisor.
	It also does an initial positioning of the new node, just below the existing node.
	A tree layout will occur automatically to position it correctly, and to adjust the positions
	of all of the other nodes, which might have to move.
	</p>
	<p>
	All of these model modifications occur within a model transaction.
	Whenever you change a diagram, you should try to do so by changing the model,
	and you should make changes to a model within a transaction.
	</p>
	<p>
	The user can also restructure the organization by dragging a node onto another node.
	This is achieved by setting <code>go:Part.DropOntoBehavior="AddsLinkFromNode"</code>.
	Furthermore, you can provide visual feedback that such drop-onto behavior may occur
	by changing the appearance of the node based on the <strong>Part.IsDropOntoAccepted</strong>
	dependency property.  In this sample the <strong>Background</strong> is bound to either
	a white brush or a red one via a <strong>BooleanBrushConverter</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The diagram uses a <strong>TreeLayout</strong> to achieve the automatic 
	positioning of the nodes.&nbsp; The <strong>Angle</strong> attribute 
	represents the direction in which the tree will grow; a value of 90 degrees 
	causes the tree to grow downwards.  However the <strong>TreeLayout.TreeStyle</strong>
	is set to "LastParents", which causes a different kind of tree layout to occur for those
	nodes (employees) that have tree children (other employees that report to them) that are
	not parents (bosses or supervisors) themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
	For those "LastParent" nodes, the tree layout will use the parameters given by the
	<strong>TreeLayout.AlternateDefaults</strong> property.  The angle is zero (rightwards)
	instead of 90 (downwards), and links go from the BottomCenter of parent nodes to the
	MiddleLeft of the child nodes, instead of to the TopCenter.
