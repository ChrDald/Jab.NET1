This sample demonstrates a Visio-like design surface where the links may have either or both ends unconnected.
</p>
<p>
If you draw a new link from a node (at the ports, where the Cursor is a Hand) but do not connect it to another port, the new link is connected at only one end.
</p>
<p>
If you reconnect an existing link to no other node/port, the link is disconnected at that end of the link.
You can disconnect both ends, if you choose.
</p>
<p>
You can then reconnect the disconnected end of a link -- either to a port on a node, or to "nothing" again, perhaps at a different location.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to drag a single link.  Doing so disconnects both ends of the link.
You can then connect either end of the link.  If the positions of the existing nodes/ports are suitable, it is even possible to connect up both ends of the link in the same drag-drop gesture.
</p>
<p>
This sample also demonstrates many customized <b>Adornment</b> templates.
The node DataTemplate specifies three custom adornment templates.
</p>
<p>
The <b>go:Part.SelectionAdornmentTemplate</b> is a thin dashed blue rectangle around the whole node.
</p>
<p>
The <b>go:Part.ResizeAdornmentTemplate</b> specifies eight blue tool handles, four at the corners and four at the middles of the sides.
There is now a <b>go:Part.ResizeElementName</b> attached property, so that the user can resize a different element from the one that gets the selection handles.
</p>
<p>
The <b>go:Part.RotateAdornmentTemplate</b> is a blue circle.
However, when the <b>go:Part.RotationAngle</b> is zero, the rotation handle is positioned above the node instead of to the right of the node.
This required a custom RotatingTool.
