This diagram demonstrates the expanding/collapsing subgraphs where members of each subgraph are only created "on-demand",
when the user clicks on the "expand" Button.
</p>
<p>
As you expand the tree, it automatically performs an animated force-directed layout
and layered-digraph layouts within subgraphs.
Remember that you can use control-mouse-wheel to zoom out and zoom into the diagram.
</p>
<p>
The data for each node is implemented by the <b>SimpleData</b> class.
It defines an <b>EverExpanded</b> property that indicates whether we have already
created all of its "member" data and added them to the model.
The <b>EverExpanded</b> property defaults to false,
to match the initial value of <b>go:Node.IsSubGraphExpanded="False"</b> in the node DataTemplate,
which specifies that the subgraphs start collapsed.
</p>
<p>
When the user clicks on the "expand" Button, the button click event handler finds the corresponding
<b>SimpleData</b> by going up the visual tree to find the <b>Node</b> and then getting its <b>Data</b>.
If <b>SimpleData.EverExpanded</b> is false, the code creates a random number of <b>SimpleData</b>
children for that node, including some that are subgraphs, each with a random <b>Color</b> property.
The code also connects each node with another node by adding the "to" node key to
the "from" node's <b>ToKeys</b> list.
Then the button click event handler changes the value of <b>Node.IsExpandedSubGraph</b>,
thereby expanding or collapsing the subgraph.
</p>
<p>
Some subgraphs result in there being no members at all.  In this case the Button is made invisible.
</p>
<p>
All changes are performed within a transaction.
You should always surround your code with <b>StartTransaction</b> and <b>CommitTransaction</b>.
</p>
<p>
The diagram's <b>Diagram.Layout</b> is an instance of <b>ForceDirectedLayout</b>.
The standard conditions under which the layout will be performed include
when nodes or links or group-memberships are added or removed from the model.
This particular <b>ForceDirectedLayout</b> also includes the condition that changing
the size of any group will cause another layout.
In this case that means that when the user expands or collapses a node,
another layout occurs again.
</p>
<p>
Each subgraph has its own <b>LayeredDigraphLayout</b> that positions its member nodes
and routes its member links.
It too is set to perform a layout whenever a member subgraph changes size.
