In addition to the standard "StepTemplate" that can display information,
there are two node DataTemplates: "TransitionTemplate" and "ParallelTemplate".
</p>
<p>
The "ParallelTemplate" is drawn as a rectangular bar whose width is bound to the
<strong>NodeData.Width</strong> property.  To allow the user to resize that <strong>Rectangle</strong>,
the <code>go:Part.SelectionElementName</code> refers to that "Bar" element.
Because that data-binding is <code>Mode=TwoWay</code>,
the data property is updated when the user resizes that rectangular bar.
</p>
<p>
The "ParallelTemplate" demonstrates the use of a custom Resize adornment.
Instead of the standard eight resize tool handles positioned within a <strong>SpotPanel</strong>,
the custom "ResizeAdornmentTemplate" uses only two tool handles,
one at the middle-left, and one at the middle-right.
Note that each <strong>Adornment</strong> for resizing a <strong>Node</strong>
is managed by the <strong>ResizingTool</strong> and is independent of other <strong>Adornment</strong>s
used by other tools.  Tool adornments are also independent of the <strong>Adornment</strong> used to show
selection (when <code>go:Part.SelectionAdorned="True"</code>).
