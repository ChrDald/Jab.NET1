This sample shows a tree structure that does not use any links.
</p>
<p>
The tree grows in alternating directions as the depth increases.
<b>TreeLayout</b> supports such layouts when you set the <b>TreeStyle</b>
to <b>Alternating</b>.&nbsp; You can specify separate layout properties for each 
tree layer by setting both <strong>TreeLayout.RootDefaults </strong>and <strong>
TreeLayout.AlternateDefaults</strong>.</p>
<p>
There's no <b>FrameworkElement.LayoutTransform</b> in Silverlight, so the
custom layout code, <b>PipeTreeLayout</b> has to do it for the pipes that
are in alternate layers.
But the use of <b>RenderTransform</b> by <b>Node.SetAngle</b>
means that each pipe angled at 90 degrees does not appear with the same
width and height that it actually is measured at.
Instead we use the Background shape, a <b>Rectangle</b>, to appear as the
pipe node, by explicitly setting its Width and Height to the appropriate size.
That background rectangle is also named as the <b>Part.SelectionElementName</b>,
so that selecting the pipe will give a selection handle to the rectangle,
not to the misleadingly sized node.</p>
