This diagram demonstrates the expansion of a tree where nodes are only created "on-demand",
when the user clicks on the "expand" Button.
</p>
<p>
As you expand the tree, it automatically performs an animated force-directed layout,
which will make some room for the additional nodes.
Remember that you can use control-mouse-wheel to zoom out and zoom into the diagram.
</p>
<p>
The data for each node is implemented by the <b>SimpleData</b> class.
It defines an <b>EverExpanded</b> property that indicates whether we have already
created all of its "child" data and added them to the model.
The <b>EverExpanded</b> property defaults to false,
to match the initial value of <b>go:Node.IsTreeExpanded="False"</b> in the node DataTemplate,
which specifies that the nodes start collapsed.
</p>
<p>
When the user clicks on the "expand" Button, the button click event handler finds the corresponding
<b>SimpleData</b> by going up the visual tree to find the <b>Node</b> and then getting its <b>Data</b>.
If <b>SimpleData.EverExpanded</b> is false, the code creates a random number of <b>SimpleData</b>
children for that node, each with a random <b>Color</b> property.
Each new <b>SimpleData</b> has a unique <b>Key</b> that is composed by appending the parent's Key
with the new Color.
Then the button click event handler changes the value of <b>Node.IsExpandedTree</b>,
thereby expanding or collapsing the node.
</p>
<p>
Some nodes result in there being no children at all.  In this case the Button is made invisible.
</p>
<p>
All changes are performed within a transaction.
You should always surround your code with <b>StartTransaction</b> and <b>CommitTransaction</b>.
</p>
<p>
The diagram's <b>Diagram.Layout</b> is an instance of <b>ForceDirectedLayout</b>.
The standard conditions under which the layout will be performed include
when nodes or links or group-memberships are added or removed from the model.
This particular <b>ForceDirectedLayout</b> also includes the condition that changing
the visibility of any node or link will cause another layout.
In this case that means that when the user expands or collapses a node,
another force-directed layout occurs again.
