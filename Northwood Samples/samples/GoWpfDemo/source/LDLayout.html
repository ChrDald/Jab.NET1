		The Layered Digraph Layout sample demonstrates organizing nodes into layers.
		Unlike <b>TreeLayout</b>, <b>LayeredDigraphLayout</b> understands about multiple links coming into a node and about cycles in the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modifying one of the properties will automatically perform another layout using the new property value,
		because the values of the <b>LayeredDigraphLayout</b> properties are data-bound to the controls in the sample.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The <b>LayerSpacing</b> property controls the distance between the layers of nodes.
	  The <b>ColumnSpacing</b> property controls the distance between adjacent nodes in the same layer.
