  This sample demonstrates the use of the <b>Bus</b> Alignment as well as the use of the <b>Comment</b> category for data entries
  to allow for assistants in an organizational chart. It also uses other features included in the Org Chart Editor sample. 
  </p>
  <p>
  There are three different options when choosing the way a Bus Alignment will appear:
  <br /><b>Bus</b>: Bus is the standard form in which children are laid out in two columns with the parent centered between them.
  <br /><b>TopLeftBus</b>: TopLeftBus positions children either above, or to the left of, the parent in a column based on the the parent's angle.
  <br /><b>BottomRightBus</b>: BottomRightBus positions children either below, or to the right of, the parent in a column based on the the parent's angle.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also demonstrated in this sample is the use of the <b>Comment</b> category for data entries for placement of assistants in an org chart.
  Using the <b>Comment</b> category in a TreeLayout will change the way the node is placed, and will also require the use of another Node template
  unless using the default Comment format of a red text node.
  We can see an assistant declared in XML in the following code:
  </p>
  <pre>&lt;Employee Key="3" ParentKey="1" Name="Herman 'Hesh' Rabkin" Title="Advisor" Category="Comment" /&gt;</pre>
  </body>
