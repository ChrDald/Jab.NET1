		The Tree Layout sample demonstrates organizing nodes into layers with many options.
		The graph is assumed to be structured as a tree.  If it sees secondary links coming into a node, it ignores them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modifying one of the properties will automatically perform another layout using the new property value,
		because the values of the <b>TreeLayout</b> properties are data-bound to the controls in the sample.
		There are two sets of tree layout properties, the "Root" defaults and the "Alternate" defaults.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <b>TreeStyle</b> property governs the general layout of the tree:
	</p>
	<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Layered</b>: The default style for <b>TreeLayout</b> which ignores all Alternate" properties and lines up children horizontally or vertically.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>LastParents</b>: The same as Layered except that nodes with children but no grandchildren use the Alternate" properties.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Alternating</b>: Alternates between the "Root" properties and the "Alternate" properties.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RootOnly</b>: The root node uses the "Root" properties; all other nodes use "Alternate" properties.<br />
	</div>
	<p>
		<b>Angle</b> sets the angle at which the trees grows for greater depth.  It can be 0 degrees (rightward), 90 (downward), 180 (leftward) or 270 (upward).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Alignment</b> controls the relative position of the parent node compared to its children.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>NodeSpacing</b> controls the amount of space between siblings.
	  <b>NodeIndent</b> specifies how much empty space to leave at the beginning of the children; this only applies if the <b>Alignment</b> is Start or End.
	  <b>NodeIndentPastParent</b> specifies whether the indentation should include some fraction of the breadth of the parent.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>LayerSpacing</b> controls the amount of space between the layers.  This should normally be greater than 20.
	  <b>LayerSpacingParentOverlap</b> specifies the fraction of the parent's depth that the children's layer should overlap with the parent's layer.
	  This is usually used only when the indentation is large enough to avoid actual overlap of any child nodes with the parent node.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Sorting</b> controls whether the children of each parent are sorted, and in which order.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Compaction</b> determines whether the layout should try to squeeze adjacent subtrees closer together, without overlapping any nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Tree layouts tend to get very broad.  To help avoid this, <b>TreeLayout</b> can lay out children into multiple rows.
	  Usually, the <b>Alignment</b> should be Start or End.
	  To enable breaking layers of children into rows, set the <b>BreadthLimit</b>. <b>BreadthLimit</b> will not affect nodes in a bus.
	  <b>RowSpacing</b> controls the distance between rows, or distance between the rows of nodes in a bus.
	  <b>RowIndent</b> specifies the indentation for each row, to permit room for the links to be routed around previous rows.
	</p>
