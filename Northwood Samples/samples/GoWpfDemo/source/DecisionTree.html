This sample allows a user to make progressive decisions about personality types.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of nodes, so there are two <strong>DataTemplate</strong>s ("DecisionNode" and "PersonalityNode") for nodes.
</p>
<p>
The "DecisionNode" template displays the abbreviated personality type and two choice buttons, all surrounded by a figure.
Clicking a button will either expand the choice or will collapse all nodes leading from that choice.
All of these changes are performed within a model transaction, by calling <strong>Diagram.StartTransaction</strong>
and <strong>Diagram.CommitTransaction</strong>.
Committing the transaction will also perform a <strong>TreeLayout</strong>,
because changing the visibility of nodes and links will invalidate the existing layout.
</p>
<p>
The "PersonalityNode" template displays the personality descriptions, as the "leaf" nodes for the tree.
