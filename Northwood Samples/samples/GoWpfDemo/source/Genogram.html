A <i>genogram</i> is an extended family tree diagram that shows information about each person
or each relationship.
</p>
<p>
The XML data is basically a list of people.
The code creates an instance of a Person class to represent each node.
Each Person has a number of properties initialized from the XML attributes:
<ul>
  <li><b>id</b>, the unique ID of the person</li>
  <li><b>n</b>, the person's name</li>
  <li><b>s</b>, the person's sex</li>
  <li><b>m</b>, the person's mother's key</li>
  <li><b>f</b>, the person's father's key</li>
  <li><b>ux</b>, the person's wife</li>
  <li><b>vir</b>, the person's husband</li>
  <li><b>a</b>, a space-separated list of the attributes or markers that the person has</li>
</ul>
There are converters that convert an attribute value into a brush color or Path Geometry,
to be added to the Node representing the person.
</p>
<p>
The <b>SetupDiagram</b> method creates all of the link data, represented by the <b>Relationship</b> class.
Relationships that are of the "Marriage" category link mothers with fathers.
Relationships of "ParentChild" category link a marriage for each child.
Note that the <b>FromNode</b> of <b>Link</b>s are not the <b>Node</b> that is the mother or the father,
but a special Node that is a Link label on a marriage Link between the mother and the father.
