This sample demonstrates how it is possible to have multiple "Instruments" attached to a link (a "Pipe")
and allow the user to shift the positions of these instruments.
</p>
<p>
It also demonstrates how a "Valve" may be dropped onto an existing "Pipe", resulting in the
valve node being spliced into the link.  The valve is automatically rotated to suit the direction of the flow within the pipe.
</p>
<p>
The LinkTemplate for each pipe is implemented using multiple link shapes of differing shades of gray.
This results in a simple gradient across the width of the pipe, regardless of the pipe's turns.
