This sample demonstrates how two <strong>Diagram</strong>s can show the same model
in two different manners and yet remain synchronized due to <strong>Model.Changed</strong> events
and the <strong>UndoManager</strong> support for transactions.
<p>
Changes to either <strong>Diagram</strong> will be reflected in the <strong>DiagramModel</strong>.
The log shows changes to the model as they occur.
The <strong>UndoManager</strong> remembers transactions for undo/redo.
The <strong>TreeView</strong> shows the UndoManager's transactions.
</p>
<p>
Note how separate <strong>DataTemplate</strong>s are used for the nodes and the links of the two diagrams.
Although the appearance of a node in one diagram is quite different than in the other diagram,
the nodes are moved in synchrony due to their binding of the <strong>go:Node.Location</strong>
dependency property to the same property on the data.
</p>
<p>
As the user undoes and redoes changes, no additional transactions are recorded in the
<strong>UndoManager</strong> or reflected in the <strong>TreeView</strong> here.
However, the currently selected top-level tree item changes to highlight the transaction
that would be redone if a Redo were to occur.
