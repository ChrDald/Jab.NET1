	This demo shows how the <b>CircularLayout</b> arranges the nodes in either a circle or ellipse.  If any
	of the properties of the layout is modified, it will automatically perform another layout using the new
	values.  The data passed into the layout can be controlled with the box on the left.  The data in the
	layout will only be updated when the &quot;update&quot; button is clicked.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>Radius</b> property allows the user to specify the horizontal radius of the ellipse.  If the <b>Spacing</b>
	is set to a number other than Infinity, The effective radius may have to be larger than the specified value
	to allow for adequate spacing.  If <b>Radius</b> is NaN, than the effective radius is determined by the
	effective spacing
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>AspectRatio</b> specifies the ratio of the ellipse's height to its width, or equivalently,
	its Y radius to its X radius.  For a circle, this value is 1.  A value of NaN or Infinity will create an
	effective aspect ratio of 1.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>StartAngle</b> specifies the angle of the 0th element (in degrees, clockwise from the 3:00 position).  A value of NaN
	or Infinity corresponds to an effective value of 0 (indicating that the zeroth node is positioned at 3:00).  Any other value
	will produce an effective value of <b>StartAngle</b> % 360, eg. Setting this value to 390 or -330 will produce the same
	result as setting it to 30.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>SweepAngle</b> sets the difference (in degrees) between the 0th and last nodes.  If the value is 90, for example, and
	<b>StartAngle</b> = 0, the zeroth node will be at 3:00 and the last one will be at 6:00.
	Valid values are in (0,360].
	If the specified value is not in this range, a value of 360 will be used.  If the value is 360, the effective
	sweep angle will be a little less to prevent the 0th node from getting too close to the last node
	</p>
	The <b>Arrangement</b> specifies how the nodes will be spaced in the layout.  There are 4 possible values:
	    <table>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>ConstantSpacing</b></td>
	            <td>The distance between the edges of the nodes is constant</td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>ConstantDistance</b></td>
	            <td>The distance between the centers of the nodes is constant</td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>ConstantAngle</b></td>
	            <td>The angular distance between the centers of the nodes is constant</td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>Packed</b></td>
	            <td>The nodes are arranged assuming they are rectangular, and <b>Radius</b> is ignored</td>
	        </tr>
	    </table>
	<p>
	The <b>Direction</b> indicates whether the nodes are arranged clockwise, counterclockwise, or alternate
	between clockwise &amp; counterclockwise (bidirectional).
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>Sorting</b> property sets how the nodes are sorted in the layout.<br/>
	<b>Forward</b> &amp; <b>Reverse</b> indicate that the nodes are arranged either in the order given or the reverse
	of the order given.  <b>Ascending</b> &amp; <b>Descending</b> indicate that the nodes are sorted using the
	<b>CircularLayout.Comparer</b> .  In the demo, the <b>Comparer</b> is set to sort the nodes by area.
	<b>Optimized</b> arranges the nodes to avoid link crossings
	</p>
	<p>
	The <b>Spacing</b> determines the minimum allowed spacing between nodes.  If the <b>Spacing</b> is large enough
	and the <b>Radius</b> is specified, the effective radius may be larger than the specified value to allow for
	adequate spacing between nodes.  A value of NaN or Infinity corresponds to an effective value of 6.
	</p>

	The <b>NodeDiameterFormula</b> specifies a method to determine the effective diameter of a node.
	There are 2 values for this:
		    <table>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>Pythagorean</b></td>
	            <td>
	            The diameter is equal to the diagonal of a rectangle with Width &amp; Height of node.
	            If <b>Spacing</b>==0, this wil make square nodes touch at 45 degrees, but no other square nodes
	            will touch.
	            </td>
	        </tr>
	        <tr>
	            <td><b>Circular</b></td>
	            <td>
	            The diameter equals either the width or height of the node, whichever is larger.
	            If <b>Spacing</b>==0, this will make circular nodes touch tangentially.
	            </td>
	        </tr>
	    </table>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>NodeRotation</b> Specifies how the nodes will be oriented in the diagram.  The choices are:
	    </p>
	    <table>
	    
	    <tr>
	    <td>
	    <b>Horizontal</b>
	    </td>
	    <td>
	    The nodes are all oriented so their top and bottom sides are paralell to the X axis
	    </td>
	    </tr>
	    
	    <tr>
	    <td>
	    <b>Paralell</b>
	    </td>
	    <td>
	    The bottom side of the nodes is paralell to the edge of the ellipse
	    </td>
	    </tr>
	    
	    <tr>
	    <td>
	    <b>Orthogonal</b>
	    </td>
	    <td>
	    The bottom side of the nodes is orthogonal to the edge of the ellipse
	    </td>
	    </tr>
	    
	    </table>
	    
	    <p>
	    The &quot;Count Crossings&quot; counts the number of times two links cross over eachother in the layout.
	    </p>
