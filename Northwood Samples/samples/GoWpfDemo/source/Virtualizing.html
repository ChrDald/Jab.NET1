	The Virtualizing sample demonstrates one way to support many thousands of nodes and links.
	The principal technique is the customization of the <b>PartManager</b> to only create <b>Node</b>s
	and <b>Link</b>s when they are visible in the <b>DiagramPanel</b>, and to delete them otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
	This sample creates 9999 nodes and 9998 links.
	The scrolling and zooming performance is a bit sluggish (worse in Silverlight than in WPF),
	but responsiveness remains good for operations on individual nodes and links.
    You will find it more responsive when zoomed in so that there are fewer nodes and links that are visible at one time.
	Without virtualization just the creation of so many <b>Node</b>s and <b>Link</b>s would
	result in a very long and unavoidable start-up time.
    </p>
    <p>
	This sample requires all node data to have a location before they have been realized
	as <b>Node</b>s in the <b>Diagram</b>.
	Because all of the regular layouts, such as <b>TreeLayout</b> and <b>LayeredDigraphLayout</b>,
	depend on knowing the actual size of each <b>Node</b> in order to perform a reasonable positioning of the nodes,
	this sample requires that there not be any layout given as the <b>Diagram.Layout</b>.
	Many of the regular layouts also route the links as part of the layout process.
	This would also require that the actual <b>Link</b>s be present so that their <b>Route</b>s can be modified.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead of a regular <b>TreeLayout</b>, this defines a <b>VirtualizingTreeLayout</b> that operates directly
    on the node and link data of the model rather than <b>Node</b>s and <b>Link</b>s of the <b>Diagram</b>.
    It uses custom <b>VirtualizingTreeVertex</b> and <b>VirtualizingTreeEdge</b> classes that know about this
    application's <b>NodeData</b> and <b>LinkData</b> data classes.
    The layout assigns the <b>NodeData.Location</b> property rather than the <b>Node.Location</b> property
    as standard layouts would do.
    However, it does not support custom routing.
    </p>
    <p>
    The standard <b>Diagram.Panel</b> is replaced with an instance of the custom <b>VirtualizingDiagramPanel</b> class.
	The use of the custom <b>VirtualizingDiagramPanel</b> class requires customizing the diagram's <b>Template</b>.
	The supplied <b>ControlTemplate</b> is exactly like the default one that you can see in the Generic.XAML
	file in the docs subdirectory of the GoXam installation, except for the replacement of the
	standard <b>DiagramPanel</b> with the custom <b>VirtualizingDiagramPanel</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
	The standard <b>Diagram.PartManager</b> is replaced with an instance of the
	custom <b>VirtualizingPartManager</b> class.
    </p>
    <p>
	Both the <b>VirtualizingPartManager</b> and the <b>VirtualizingDiagramPanel</b> make all of their geometric
	calculations based on the node data and the relationships provided by the model.
	They must not depend on the actual <b>Node</b>.<b>Bounds</b>, because the whole point of virtualization
	is to avoid creating <b>FrameworkElement</b>s such as <b>Node</b>s.
    </p>
    <p>
	If you want to use the code of this sample, you will need to adapt the <b>ComputeNodeBounds</b> method
	to return reasonably accurate values for your particular node data, as if they had been realized with
	the actual <b>DataTemplate</b>s that your application uses.
	Remember also that the <b>Node.Location</b> in your application might not be the point
	at the top-left corner of the <b>Bounds</b> for that node.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to use a different kind of layout, you will need to customize that layout in a manner similar to how
    the <b>TreeLayout</b> was modified to support virtualization.
