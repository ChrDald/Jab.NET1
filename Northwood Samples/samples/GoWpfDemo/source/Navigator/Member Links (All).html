	If the selected part is a <strong>Group</strong>, 
	this collection includes all <strong>Link</strong>s whose parent is your selected 
	<strong>Group</strong>, or whose parent is recursively a member group of 
	your selected group.&nbsp; For example, <strong>Group</strong> Chi has no immediate child 
	member <strong>Link</strong>s. However, <strong>Link</strong> D --> F is a member of 
	<strong>Group</strong> Omega, which in turn is a member
of <strong>Group</strong> Psi. Thus, clicking on Chi will result in <strong>Link</strong> D --> F being highlighted.</p>
	<p>The logic to highlight the appropriate <strong>Link</strong>s is in the
	<strong>RecursiveChildren</strong> method.&nbsp; Each successive child 
	relationship increases the <strong>Highlight</strong> property value.</p>
