</h4>
<p>
If the selected part is a <strong>Group</strong>, 
this collection includes all <strong>Node</strong>s whose parent is your selected 
<strong>Group</strong>, and all of their child nodes, recursively.&nbsp; For example, 
<strong>Group</strong> Psi is the only immediate child member <strong>Node</strong> of 
<strong>Group</strong> Chi.&nbsp; However, <strong>Node</strong> F is a member of 
<strong>Group</strong> Omega, which in turn is a member
of <strong>Group</strong> Psi. Thus, clicking on Chi will result in Node F being highlighted 
as well.</p>
	<p>
	The logic to highlight the appropriate <strong>Node</strong>s is in the
	<strong>RecursiveChildren</strong> method.&nbsp; Each successive child 
	relationship increases the <strong>Highlight</strong> property value.
