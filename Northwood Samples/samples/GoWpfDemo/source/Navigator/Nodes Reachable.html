</h4>
	<p>The collection of "Nodes Reachable" from a particular 
	<strong>Part</strong> contains all (and only) those <strong>Node</strong>s that can be reached by following the following a path
of <strong>Link</strong>s. For example, <strong>Node</strong> D is reachable from 
	<strong>Node</strong> A, since one can reach D from A via <strong>Link</strong>s A --> C and C --> D.&nbsp;
	<strong>Node</strong> A, however, is not reachable from <strong>Node</strong> D.</p>
	<p>The 
logic to highlight the appropriate <strong>Node</strong>s is in the <strong>
	RecursiveTo</strong> method.&nbsp; It will set the data's <strong>Highlight</strong> 
	property to increasing values as the nodes are &quot;farther away&quot; in terms of 
	relationships, not in terms of Cartesian distance.</p>
