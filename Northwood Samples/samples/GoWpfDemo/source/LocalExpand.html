This sample demonstrates one manner in which a diagram can show more detail where the mouse is.
The diagram expands any <b>Group</b>s that intersect a rectangular area centered about the mouse.
</p>
<p>
The functionality is implemented by a custom default tool, <b>LocallyExpandingToolManager</b>.
It replaces the standard <b>Diagram.DefaultTool</b>.
This tool overrides the <b>DoMouseMove</b> method to look for <b>Group</b>s that overlap with the rectangular area near the mouse.
Such <b>Group</b>s are expanded; all other <b>Group</b>s are collapsed.
