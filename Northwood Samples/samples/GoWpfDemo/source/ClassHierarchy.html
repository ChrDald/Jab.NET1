Show the class hierarchy for the classes in GoXam.
</p>
<p>
Because we know that the class hierarchy is tree structured, we can use a
<b>TreeModel</b> as the <b>Diagram.Model</b>.
The node data type is a simple class that we define, <b>TypeInfo</b>,
to hold the needed property values.
(A named class is needed to avoid reflection permission exceptions when the
sample is running with limited permissions.)
</p>
<p>
Each node is identified by its <b>FullName</b>, but the node <b>DataTemplate</b>
only displays its <b>Name</b>.&nbsp; The<strong> FullName</strong> is shown via 
a tooltip.&nbsp; The name shown for generic types may look funny, but that&#39;s how 
it is.</p>
<p>
The reference from one <b>TypeInfo</b> to its base class data is by a string, 
the<strong> FullName </strong>identifier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
The link template is minimal -- just a thin black line.
No arrowhead is necessary in this sample.</p>
